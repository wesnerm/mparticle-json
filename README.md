# MP.Json.Validation

## Introduction

MP.Json.Validation is a high-performance JSON Schema validation library for validating JSON documents against a schema. This library was built for our DataPlanning feature to support the real-time validation of a large number of event messages passing through our system each second.

It includes an extremely lightweight JSON document object and an equally lightweight JSON Schema object model. It supports JSON parsing and JSON Schema validation of JSON documents against JSON schemas.

We built this library because other JSON Schema validation libraries did not perform fast enough and/or simply consumed too much memory. This library has been able to perform validation 1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster than other packages such as Newtonsoft.Json.Schema and Manatee.Json. The memory footprint of each schema is also a tenth or more of Newtonsoft.Json.Schema.

MP.Json.Validation also conforms to the latest standards including Drafts 4, 6, 7 and 2019-09 of JsonSchema. It's been validated by industry-standard JSON and JSON Schema Test Suites.

## Documentation

Documentation for the MP.Json.Validation library is maintained in the wiki for the repository.

## Installation

This library is available  as a package in Nuget as MP.Json.Validation.

### Memory Usage

|                       |     Memory  | Time to Load|
|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|
|Raw Strings            |   449.5 MB  |        0.39s|
|ManateeJSON            |   886.3 MB  |       24.52s|
|Newtonsoft.Json.Schema | 3,710.0 MB  |       51.20s|
|MP.Json.Schema         |   414.1 MB  |        7.70s|
|- without metadata     |    87.8 MB  |        5.05s|

(Memory tests in release mode, 64-bit.)

MP.Json.Schema objects are so efficient that they take less memory than that of the JSON schema stored as strings.

In this benchmark, we are seeing a factor of 15-20X improvement in validation times with MP.Json.Validation against Newtonsoft.Json.Schema and hundreds of times more against ManateeJson. 

MP.Json.Validation claims the top eight spots. With a larger batch size of 25 and without caching of schemas, it still outperforms validation by competing products with just a batch size of 1 with caching.
